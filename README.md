# Score Predictor - My First ML Project 🎯

A machine learning web application that predicts scores using various ML algorithms. This project focuses primarily on the machine learning implementation and model performance rather than UI/UX design.

## 📋 Project Overview

This is my first machine learning project where I explored different algorithms and techniques to build a score prediction system. The emphasis was placed on:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Comparing multiple ML algorithms
- Creating a functional web interface for predictions

**Note:** The UI is intentionally simple (no CSS styling) as the main focus was on mastering the machine learning concepts and implementation.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach

### Algorithms Used
- **Scikit-learn** models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- **XGBoost** - Gradient boosting framework
- **CatBoost** - Categorical feature handling

### Data Processing
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization and analysis

### Model Persistence
- **Dill** for model serialization and deployment

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Flask (Python web framework)
- **ML Libraries:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model Serialization:** Dill
- **Frontend:** Basic HTML (no CSS - focus on functionality)

## 📦 Setup Instructions
